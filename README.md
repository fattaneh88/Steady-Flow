# Steady-Flow
In this project, we provide a collocation method for the problem of steady flow of a third grade fluid in a porous half space. This problem is a non-linear, two-point boundary value problem (BVP) on semi-infinite interval. This approach is based on a modifies generalized Laguerre which is an orthogonal function.
