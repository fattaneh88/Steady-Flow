# Steady-Flow
Here is all the implementations of the following publications:

F. Bayat Babolghani, K. Parand. Comparison between Hermite and Sinc collocation methods for solving steady flow of a third grade fluid in a porous half space, to WORLDCOMP'13 (CSC'13), Nevada, July 2013

K. Parand, F. Bayat Babolghani. Applying the Modified Generalized Laguerre Functions for Solving Steady Flow of a Third Grade Fluid in a Porous Half Space, to World Applied Science Journal 2012

Our implementations were built in Maple 2013.
